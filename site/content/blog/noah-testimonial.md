Good Evening all,

My name is Noah. I am 20 years old and I identify as a queer trans* guy. I have never done a speech before, or any kind of public speaking for that matter, so bear with me.

This amazing place, where we are all gathered, has been my home away from home for the past… I can’t even believe it myself; 4 and a half years! I started coming to the LGBTQ youth centre when I was 16 years old, a time when there was literally not a single person in my life that I knew, who identified under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. So it was a pretty lonely time… well except Ellen, she kept me company. Anyway, I spent over 2 years extremely isolated, hating the fact that I was gay, not knowing what to do or where to go. Wishing, more than anything, that it wasn’t true. Those two years were the hardest years of my life. Trying to manage my inner homophobia and feeling so isolated, life became too much to handle and at 16 years old I attempted suicide. I scared myself so much that I realized I had to do something in order to change my life. So I reached out for help, and I was told that ‘there was this LGBTQ youth centre in Beaconsfield which is apparently really good’…. So I was like, huh, that sounds cool, maybe I’ll go.... It took me 3 long months to pluck up the courage to walk through those doors. For 12 weeks, I thought “I can do this”, until eventually, I did.

Now my memory of the first time I did walk through the youth centre doors, is one that will stick in my mind for the rest of my life. It’s not necessarily an interesting story or a funny story… it was just such a life altering moment in my life, that it won’t be easily forgotten.

It was a Friday afternoon, I had made up some lie to tell my parents about what I was doing after school and I walked all the way to the centre. I remember walking through the outside doors, seeing the signs, I was so nervous. Eventually I got to the centres doors, stood in the doorway and saw two guys sitting inside. It was Shaun and Simon, our former coordinator and a volunteer. I said “hi” and Shaun, with his wonderful smile, stood up and said “Hi I’m Shaun, I’m the coordinator here, welcome to the youth centre”. On the TV in the corner, The Hobbit movie was playing, and I said “oh that’s a really good movie!” which Simon replied “I like this kid already”. And that was it, I was instantly at home. I met so many amazing people, learnt so much about the community and I just felt so welcome and accepted at the centre. After only 2 weeks of attending the centre, I went from a self-hating, isolated and lonely teenager to a confident one with so much more love for being gay. 3 weeks later, I had become so confident that I came out to my parents and today, 4 years later, I wouldn’t trade being gay for ANYTHING in the world. This youth centre took me from wanting to die because I was gay, to it being the thing that I love MOST about myself.


So please, help us keep this amazing, local, non-profit organization up and running, because without it, me and so many of my closest friends would not be the confident people we are today.

Thank you!
