As a parent; has your child recently come out to you and you don’t know how to take it? Is your child transitioning and you are unsure how to show your support or vent your concerns? Do you think your child might be gay or lesbian?

As a youth; do you feel like your parents just don’t understand you? Are you tired of trying to talk to your parents about your orientation?

Our parent support group, which meets on the second Thursday of every month, provides a space for parents and family members to come to discuss their concerns or questions about their family member’s orientation. The parent’s support group is designed to be a judgement free space where we give you the resources to explore resources.

### Drop-in hours

`Second Thursday of each month - 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.`
