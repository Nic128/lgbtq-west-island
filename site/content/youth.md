The LGBTQ Youth Centre is a space where high school and CEGEP aged queer youth can come to spend time with likeminded individuals. Our Centre provides a safe space free from the judgment of prejudice that LGBTQ individuals may face in their day to day life.

We offer a wide range of events and activities year round; Themed Parties (Halloween, Winter Holiday, Valentines Day.), Annual Gay Proms, Summer and Winter Camps, and many others. We also host fun and engaging workshops, designed to focus on.
